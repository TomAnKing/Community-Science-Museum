      <h1>Biology and Medicine</h1>
      <p>
        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
        are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
        world.

      <p>
        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
        of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
        medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine
        and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
        penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal
        discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
        animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
